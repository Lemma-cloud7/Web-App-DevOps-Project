- **Data Validation:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness with required fields, date restrictions, and card number validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.
- # Documentation for the `delivery_date` Feature

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive details about the `delivery_date` feature that was implemented and later reverted in the Web App DevOps Project. This feature aimed to add a delivery date attribute to the orders in the application.

## For Developers

### Overview of the Feature

The `delivery_date` feature was designed to allow users to specify and view the delivery dates for orders. This feature involves changes in the database schema, the backend Python script (`app.py`), and the frontend HTML template (`order.html`).

### Implementation Details

#### Database Schema Changes

- A new column named `delivery_date` of type `DateTime` was added to the `orders` table in the backend database.

#### Backend Changes (`app.py`)

- Order class in `app.py` was modified to include the `delivery_date` attribute.
- Routes handling order creation and display were updated to process the `delivery_date`.

#### Frontend Changes (`order.html`)

- The `order.html` template was updated to include an input field for adding and a table column for displaying the `delivery_date`.


### Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issue:**
  - Ensure the correct database credentials and connection strings are used.
  - Verify network accessibility to the Azure SQL Database.
  - Check if the ODBC driver is installed and configured correctly.
### Reverting the Feature

- The feature was reverted due to a change in project requirements. The revert process involved the following steps:
  - Identifying the commit hash prior to the feature implementation.
  - Executing `git revert COMMIT_HASH`.
  - Resolving any merge conflicts and committing the revert.

## Conclusion

While the `delivery_date` feature is currently not part of the application, this documentation serves as a reference for future implementation needs. The feature could be reintroduced or modified based on future project requirements.



# Docker Containerization Documentation

## Introduction

Containerization with Docker ensures a consistent and isolated environment for the application, facilitating easier development, testing, and deployment.

## Dockerfile Breakdown

The Dockerfile is a crucial component in the Docker containerization process. It defines the environment in which the application runs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the Dockerfile:

### Base Image

- `python:3.8-slim`
- **Purpose:** This image provides a lightweight Python environment which is ideal for running the Flask application.
### Working Directory

-  `WORKDIR /app`
- **Purpose:** Sets the working directory inside the container. This is where the application code resides in the container.

### Copy Application Files

-  `COPY . /app`
- **Purpose:** Copies our application files from the current directory on the host into the `/app` directory in the container.

### Install Dependencies

- **ODBC Driver and System Dependencies:**
  - Includes installation of `unixodbc`, `unixodbc-dev`, `odbcinst`, `libpq-dev`, `gcc`, and `msodbcsql17`.
  - **Purpose:** These are necessary for establishing a connection to the Azure SQL Database.
- **Python Packages:**
  - **Command:** `RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt`
  - **Purpose:** Installs the Python packages required for the application, as specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Exposing Port

- **Directive:** `EXPOSE 5000`
- **Purpose:** Exposes port 5000 of the container, allowing the Flask application to be accessible.

### Startup Command

- **Directive:** `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`
- **Purpose:** Specifies the command to run the Flask application when the container starts.

## Docker Commands Used

Documenting the Docker commands used in the project:

- **Build the Image:**
  - `docker build -t <image-name> .`
  - **Explanation:** This command builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
- **Run the Container:**
  - `docker run -p 5000:5000 <image-name>`
  - **Explanation:** Runs the Docker container and maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on the host machine.
- **Tagging the Image for Docker Hub:**
  - `docker tag <local-image-name> <docker-hub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>`
  - **Explanation:** Tags the image for pushing to Docker Hub.
- **Pushing to Docker Hub:**
  - `docker push <docker-hub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>`
  - **Explanation:** Pushes the image to Docker Hub.

## Image Information

- **Name and Tag:** `<docker-hub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>`
- **Usage:** Include instructions or special notes about using the image.

## Cleanup Process

To maintain a tidy development environment:

- **Remove Containers:**
  - List containers: `docker ps -a`
  - Remove a container: `docker rm <container-id>`
- **Remove Images:**
  - List images: `docker images -a`
  - Remove an image: `docker rmi <image-id>`

## Conclusion

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the containerization process with Docker. It should serve as a reference for current and future team members working on the Project.



# Infrastructure as Code for Networking Services

## Overview

This document outlines the process and steps taken to define networking resources for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Terraform. This approach ensures a repeatable, consistent deployment of the networking infrastructure.

## Terraform Networking Module

### Resources Created

1. **Azure Resource Group (`azurerm_resource_group`):**
   - **Purpose:** Serves as a container that holds related resources for this networking solution.
   - **Name:** Defined by `resource_group_name` variable.

2. **Virtual Network (VNet) (`azurerm_virtual_network`):**
   - **Purpose:** Provides a private network for the AKS cluster.
   - **Name:** "aks-vnet"
   - **Address Space:** Specified by `vnet_address_space` variable.

3. **Subnets (`azurerm_subnet`):**
   - **Control Plane Subnet (`control-plane-subnet`):**
     - Hosts the control plane components of the AKS cluster.
   - **Worker Node Subnet (`worker-node-subnet`):**
     - Used for AKS worker nodes.
   - **Dependencies:** Both subnets depend on the VNet.

4. **Network Security Group (NSG) (`azurerm_network_security_group`):**
   - **Purpose:** Provides security rules for network traffic to and from Azure resources.
   - **Name:** "aks-nsg"

5. **NSG Rules (`azurerm_network_security_rule`):**
   - **kube-apiserver-rule:**
     - Allows traffic to the kube-apiserver.
   - **ssh-rule:**
     - Enables SSH traffic for management purposes.
   - **Source Address:** Configured for a placeholder IP (or specific IPs as needed).

### Input Variables

- `resource_group_name`: The name for the Azure Resource Group.
- `location`: Azure region for deploying resources.
- `vnet_address_space`: Address space for the Virtual Network.

### Output Variables

- `vnet_id`: The ID of the Virtual Network.
- `control_plane_subnet_id`: The ID of the control plane subnet.
- `worker_node_subnet_id`: The ID of the worker node subnet.
- `networking_resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group used.
- `aks_nsg_id`: The ID of the Network Security Group.

### Steps to Apply Configuration

1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Run `terraform init` in the root directory to initialize the project.

2. **Plan Deployment:**
   - Execute `terraform plan` to review the changes Terraform will make.

3. **Apply Configuration:**
   - Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create resources.
