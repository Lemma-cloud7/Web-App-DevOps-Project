## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.
- # Documentation for the `delivery_date` Feature

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive details about the `delivery_date` feature that was implemented and later reverted in the Web App DevOps Project. This feature aimed to add a delivery date attribute to the orders in the application.

## For Developers

### Overview of the Feature

The `delivery_date` feature was designed to allow users to specify and view the delivery dates for orders. This feature involves changes in the database schema, the backend Python script (`app.py`), and the frontend HTML template (`order.html`).

### Implementation Details

#### Database Schema Changes

- A new column named `delivery_date` of type `DateTime` was added to the `orders` table in the backend database.

#### Backend Changes (`app.py`)

- Order class in `app.py` was modified to include the `delivery_date` attribute.
- Routes handling order creation and display were updated to process the `delivery_date`.

#### Frontend Changes (`order.html`)

- The `order.html` template was updated to include an input field for adding and a table column for displaying the `delivery_date`.


### Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issue:**
  - Ensure the correct database credentials and connection strings are used.
  - Verify network accessibility to the Azure SQL Database.
  - Check if the ODBC driver is installed and configured correctly.
### Reverting the Feature

- The feature was reverted due to a change in project requirements. The revert process involved the following steps:
  - Identifying the commit hash prior to the feature implementation.
  - Executing `git revert COMMIT_HASH`.
  - Resolving any merge conflicts and committing the revert.

## Conclusion

While the `delivery_date` feature is currently not part of the application, this documentation serves as a reference for future implementation needs. The feature could be reintroduced or modified based on future project requirements.



# Docker Containerization Documentation

## Introduction

Containerization with Docker ensures a consistent and isolated environment for the application, facilitating easier development, testing, and deployment.

## Dockerfile Breakdown

The Dockerfile is a crucial component in the Docker containerization process. It defines the environment in which the application runs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the Dockerfile:

### Base Image

- `python:3.8-slim`
- **Purpose:** This image provides a lightweight Python environment which is ideal for running the Flask application.
### Working Directory

-  `WORKDIR /app`
- **Purpose:** Sets the working directory inside the container. This is where the application code resides in the container.

### Copy Application Files

-  `COPY . /app`
- **Purpose:** Copies our application files from the current directory on the host into the `/app` directory in the container.

### Install Dependencies

- **ODBC Driver and System Dependencies:**
  - Includes installation of `unixodbc`, `unixodbc-dev`, `odbcinst`, `libpq-dev`, `gcc`, and `msodbcsql17`.
  - **Purpose:** These are necessary for establishing a connection to the Azure SQL Database.
- **Python Packages:**
  - **Command:** `RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt`
  - **Purpose:** Installs the Python packages required for the application, as specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Exposing Port

- **Directive:** `EXPOSE 5000`
- **Purpose:** Exposes port 5000 of the container, allowing the Flask application to be accessible.

### Startup Command

- **Directive:** `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`
- **Purpose:** Specifies the command to run the Flask application when the container starts.

## Docker Commands Used

Documenting the Docker commands used in the project:

- **Build the Image:**
  - `docker build -t <image-name> .`
  - **Explanation:** This command builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
- **Run the Container:**
  - `docker run -p 5000:5000 <image-name>`
  - **Explanation:** Runs the Docker container and maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on the host machine.
- **Tagging the Image for Docker Hub:**
  - `docker tag <local-image-name> <docker-hub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>`
  - **Explanation:** Tags the image for pushing to Docker Hub.
- **Pushing to Docker Hub:**
  - `docker push <docker-hub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>`
  - **Explanation:** Pushes the image to Docker Hub.

## Image Information

- **Name and Tag:** `<docker-hub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>`
- **Usage:** Include instructions or special notes about using the image.

## Cleanup Process

To maintain a tidy development environment:

- **Remove Containers:**
  - List containers: `docker ps -a`
  - Remove a container: `docker rm <container-id>`
- **Remove Images:**
  - List images: `docker images -a`
  - Remove an image: `docker rmi <image-id>`

## Conclusion

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the containerization process with Docker. It should serve as a reference for current and future team members working on the Project.



# Infrastructure as Code for Networking Services

## Main Configuration File

The `main.tf` file is the heart of the Terraform configuration. It contains the following key components:

### Provider Setup

The Azure provider is configured to allow Terraform to interact with Azure resources.

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
Credentials are not hard-coded but are supplied via environment variables in the secrets.tfvars file for enhanced security.
Networking Module Integration
The networking module sets up the necessary network infrastructure for the AKS cluster.
module "networking" {
  source = "./networking-module"
  resource_group_name = "networking-resource-group"
  location = "UK South"
  vnet_address_space = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
Input Variables:

resource_group_name: Name of the Azure resource group for networking resources.
location: Azure region where networking resources are deployed.
